## Web Component: `<podcast-preview>`

The app uses a custom Web Component for displaying podcast cards:

### Attributes
- `title` (string): Podcast title
- `image` (string): URL of the podcast cover image
- `seasons` (number): Number of seasons available
- `updated` (string): ISO date string of the last update
- `genres` (string): Comma-separated list of genre IDs

### Events
- `podcastSelected`: Dispatched when the component is clicked, containing podcast data


### 3. Abstraction

- Internals (like how date formatting or genre mapping works) are hidden behind clear interfaces (`DateUtils.format, GenreService.getNames`).

- Consumers donâ€™t need to know how something works, only what it does.

### 4. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

- Each module does one thing:
  - `DateUtils.js` â€“ formats dates
  - `createModal.js` â€“ controls the modal
  - `createPodcastCard.js` â€“ creates UI for one podcast
  - `createGrid.js` â€“ manages layout and rendering

### 5. Clear Entry Point

- `index.js` acts as the orchestrator, setting up the app and wiring components together.
- This keeps global logic and setup in one place.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Browse through the podcast cards.
3. Click a card to view more information in the modal.
4. Click "Close" to return to the list.
