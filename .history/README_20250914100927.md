# DJS02 Podcast App with Web Components

This project is a **modular vanilla 

## Features

- Renders podcast cards dynamically
- Opens a modal with more information on click
- Uses genre and season data for display
- Formats dates cleanly and consistently
- Follows **modular design** using **factory functions**

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Modular Design**

- Code is split into small, focused modules.
- Each file has a **single responsibility**, making it easier to understand and maintain.

### 2. **Factory Functions**

- Modules like `createPodcastCard`, `createGrid`, and `createModal` return objects that encapsulate logic.
- This promotes **encapsulation** and **reuse**.

  Example:

  ```js
  const grid = createGrid();
  grid.render(podcastList);
  ```

### 3. Abstraction

- Internals (like how date formatting or genre mapping works) are hidden behind clear interfaces (`DateUtils.format, GenreService.getNames`).

- Consumers don’t need to know how something works, only what it does.

### 4. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

- Each module does one thing:
  - `DateUtils.js` – formats dates
  - `createModal.js` – controls the modal
  - `createPodcastCard.js` – creates UI for one podcast
  - `createGrid.js` – manages layout and rendering

### 5. Clear Entry Point

- `index.js` acts as the orchestrator, setting up the app and wiring components together.
- This keeps global logic and setup in one place.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Browse through the podcast cards.
3. Click a card to view more information in the modal.
4. Click "Close" to return to the list.
